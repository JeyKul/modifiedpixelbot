Hm\.\.\. Weird

A System bootloop is most likely caused by the User\.

First you need to think, what you did before you got into the loop\.

If you installed a Module in magisk, boot to TWRP and go to `Advanced` and click on `Filemanager`\.

Then, if you are located in `/sdcard`, click on `\(Up A Level\)` and you are now in `/`\. 
Navigate to `/data/adb/modules` and delete your recently installed module\.


If this bootloop appeared after installing the rom, well\.\.\. Wait for atleast 10 more minutes\. 

This doesn't help? Then go to TWRP and try installing [Magisk](https://bytestransfer.com/download/txvcxv7hnpy00pgfmiiz4k0y7)\.

If that still doesnt help, make sure that you checked the /errormessages\!

We will find a solution for your problem\.
