Oh well\.\.\.

The fix is easy \:D

Go to TWRP\. 

Go to Wipe and delete dalvik / ART Cache, Cache, System, Vendor, Data\. IF YOU SWIPE NOW, ALL YOUR APPS AND DATA \(exept for Internal storage\) WILL BE GONE\!

After you did that, go back to home and go to install\. 

Select your Noble\.zip and install it\. If you are new to rooting and this is your first time installing a Rom, choose "NO DEBLOAT" or "ALEXIS DEBLOAD"\.
Quick note: If you select "ALEXIS DEBLOAT", you wont be able to connect to VPN\.


After you installed the zip it should boot now\.

Have Fun\!
